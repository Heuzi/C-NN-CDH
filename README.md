# C-NN-CDH

## Introduction

The code contains everything you need to conduct the experiment to compare the accuracy and balanced accuracy of following systems:

1-NN, 3-NN, neural network, normal C-CDH, C-NN-CDH, EAC-NN-CDH, C2C-NN-CDH.

Section "Data Preparation" includes dependencies and code to build the neural networks.

Section "Separate the training and testing" contains the training and testing procedures.

Section "Graph and report" contains functions to do graph.

Section "KFOLD CODE" contains necessary code to run a k-fold experiment on a data set.

Section "Dataset loading: XXX" load a data set XXX and preprocess it.

Section "Trying 10 fold: Credit dataset" runs the experiment with some hyperparameter settings.

Other sections are not necessary to run an experiment but kept there for potential extension.
